With a base of soy protein in place of meat, and bathed in an equally flavorful, slightly spicy sauce, Trader Joe's Vegan Tikka Masala skyrocketed to fame and earned a coveted spot in our Customer Choice Awards, right alongside its meat-based counterpart.While either of these Indian entrees are incredible served as-is, they're cleverly complemented in the company of organic peas, creamy yogurt, tangy mango chutney, and freshly chopped cilantro.

She tinkered with the recipe for months-settling on a 30% freshly diced avocado base and ultimately adding some diced jalapenos to the list of inclusions-and now we're pleased to offer Trader Joe's Avocado Tzatziki Dip, the [tangy, creamy, and totally addictive] fruit of her labor.

        "description": "Made with certified organic, pasteurized cow's milk and aged for a minimum of 10 months on wooden boards, Trader Joe's Organic Gouda Cheese taps into a tradition of Dutch Gouda production that goes back to the 12th century. With 10 months of aging, it's been given just enough time to develop superbly nutty & lightly caramel-y flavors, while maintaining a slightly crystallized yet impossibly creamy texture that's just soft enough for easy shredding and melting.This combination of nuttiness and slight creaminess makes Trader Joe's Organic Dutch Gouda a perfect complement to tart, tannic fruit, or dry, snappy white wines and ciders. To demonstrate, in this recipe we encourage its savory study on a cheese plate, alongside TJ's Smoked Gouda and 1,000 Day Aged Gouda. Paired with tart stone fruit, sweet melon and dry roasted almonds, you'll have Gouda vibes all summer long...",

The cow's milk offers a milder flavor than sheep's milk, while retaining the pleasant tanginess so favored by feta fans. The curds are bathed in a salty brine (think of it as \"pickling\" but with cheese!), then drained, gently pressed and dried to allow the saltiness to infuse throughout. This process creates a buttery tanginess and a slightly firm texture that crumbles with ease. Crumbly, briny Cheese made with organic milk? Be still our palates! Although a handful of Feta atop a crisp romaine salad is a wonderful thing, there's an endless number of ways to enjoy its salty goodness outside of leafy greens. Stir it into rigatoni with sausage, white beans, and kale. Gently warm some green olives in olive oil with chili flakes and lemon peel, then pour the mixture over a shallow bowl of Organic Crumbled Feta Cheese, and serve with crusty bread for dipping. Or, mix it with TJ's Fresh Bruschetta Sauce and Steamed Lentils for an instant appetizer, side dish, or light lunch.",

And, boy, is this Salsa versatile. Sure, you can use it as you would any other-in burritos, tacos, and quesadillas, with tortilla chips, etc. But you can also use it in less expected ways. Spoon it atop baked chicken or fish. Pour a few jars into a slow cooker with TJ's Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs and vegetables. Use it as the sauce on a tasty Mexican-inspired pizza. Or, simply pour it over rich cream cheese for a lightning-fast appetizer, and dig in with your favorite TJ's Tortilla Chips!",

Unlike most of the dried fruit you'd find at a grocery or convenience store, these Grapes are free from added sulfur (unsulfured), free from added sugar (unsweetened), and never exposed to any high temperatures in the drying process.Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Red Seedless Grape Slices are great for snacking anytime-we've discovered that smaller children find them not only delicious, but surprisingly fascinating as well. But, least you think these Grape Slices are just for kids, we're pleased to inform you that they also make a great addition to a bowl of cereal, a batch of trek mix, or a scoop of ice cream. You could even pair them with Trader Joe's Bamba Peanut Snacks to evoke the flavors of PB&J in crunchy snack form...",

The smooth creaminess of the Cheddar gives way to a tangy flavor and slightly crumbly texture, a subtle hint of salt crystallization is discovered, and it begins to taste like an aged Parmesan. Surprising, astonishing, and unanticipated. Unexpected indeed! This easy appetizer recipe imbues the classic holiday cheese ball with that same Unexpected spirit-it's a little spicy, very cheesy, and utterly irresistible.",

As the hams age, their flavor intensifies and their character builds, resulting in richly-flavored Prosciutto that's outstanding on Panini with arugula & Asiago, and super on a pizza-try it with pesto or a cream-based sauce and inch-long cuts of asparagus. We especially enjoy it with fresh melon in this no-cook, summery appetizer recipe that pairs wonderfully with a crisp, fruity rose or dry cider.",

This is the easier-to-eat, less-messy version of elote, where the corn is cut off the cob, put into a cup, and mixed with the aforementioned mayo & cotija. Modeled after the latter, Trader Joe's Mexican Style Roasted Corn with Cotija Cheese is the at-home version of this favored street food, and your ticket to a deceptively simple summer side dish. Spiked with lime juice and studded with cilantro, the frozen corn is enrobed in a creamy, smoky sauce that melts as it cooks, delivering a crunchy, spicy dish that packs a huge hit of flavor without a ton of prep work. Enjoy this Mexican Style Roasted Corn with Cotija Cheese as-is, or toss with al dente TJ's Red Lentil Sedanini and tender Organic Black Beans for a refreshing take on pasta salad.",

To make the pickling brine, combine fruit juice, vinegar, honey, ginger and cinnamon in a medium sized nonreactive pot (any pot EXCEPT that made of aluminum, cast iron or copper). Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 3-5 minutes. To pickle the peaches, add peach segments and cook just until tender, about 3-5 minutes. Carefully remove peaches with a slotted spoon and transfer to a glass jar with a resealable lid. Let pickling mixture cool slightly and then pour over peaches. Seal with lid and store in the refrigerator. Ready to eat immediately, but will develop more flavor overnight. Each batch should keep for an additional week or two in the refrigerator. If any off flavors or smells develop, or if you notice fermentation, please discard. Pairing & Serving Suggestions: Perfect served alongside roasted chicken or ham, warmed and spooned over vanilla ice cream, or even pureed and mixed into a cocktail (try it with sparkling grape juice, prosecco or bourbon)..."

That's probably due to the triple play of sour cream, cream cheese and mayo at its base. Pumping up the onion flavor are real, fresh, caramelized yellow and white onions, something we haven't encountered in other pre-made dips. What a difference!You'll find our crunchy Ridge Cut Salt & Pepper Potato Chips and tender Mini Meatballs countering that coveted creaminess in this slider recipe. While it's plenty to prep for a party, the recipe halves easily for a dinner of weeknight proportions as well.",

With its subtle hints of cacao and powerful berry tang, acai's rich, complex flavor profile is refreshingly irresistible. On-the-go cafes and juiceries have devoted entire sections of their menus to energizing smoothies and filling breakfast bowls made with this brilliant berry of the Amazon. These menu offerings, however, are typically packed with sugar and are often quite expensive. So this is us, taking matters into our own hands. And our own bowls. Got a few minutes and a blender? Then grab a packet of Trader Joe's Organic Unsweetened Acai Puree and give this tantalizingly tropical, easy-peasy recipe a try. Your body-and your wallet-will thank you.",

Earthy cauliflower, fried onions, and the aforementioned cheese create the classic, belly-warming breakfast profile: craveably savory and utterly delicious. To amp up the protein content, our supplier uses egg whites, whole eggs, and whey protein concentrate-add it all up, and you get about 12 grams of protein and 15% of your daily calcium needs, at just 5 grams of carbs per fully-cooked Frittata! To achieve peak Frittata perfection, simply reheat in the microwave or bake to your heart's (and your schedule's) content. Its plump disc shape makes it just the right size for an egg sandwich on a TJ's British Muffin. On the other hand, if you're going for a lower carb concoction, set one of these Frittatas atop a bed of crisp salad greens dressed in vinaigrette, and you've got a satisfying meal on your hands, with hardly any fuss.",

Our supplier takes salted, puffed, medium-grain white rice (and nothing else!) and grinds it into a flurry of Crumbs designed to create a gloriously crisp crunch when baked or fried. In addition to their Gluten Free distinction, these kosher-certified Crumbs contain no added sugar or other extraneous seasonings; their mild flavor is equally adaptable to any sweet or savory recipe calling for bread crumbs-versatility for the win! Here, we've combined them with savory Parmesan cheese and our equally versatile 21 Seasoning Salute for a delightfully seasoned baked chicken tender coating.",

After tinkering with the recipe for a stretch to get it juuuust right, a new star was born: Trader Joe's Broccoli & Kale Pizza Crust. Like its predecessors, its gluten-free ingredient list is simple as can be: broccoli and black kale (which make up over 50% of the recipe), corn flour, water, cornstarch, potato starch, olive oil, and salt. For the best Broccoli & Kale Crust-ed pizza of your life, pre-cooking the crust is a must prior to adding your toppings. Do so, and you'll be rewarded with crispy edges and a slightly chewy center, not to mention earthy, vegetal flavor...  ",

We've opted for a high quality, tender brisket cut with no nitrates or nitrites, which creates an impossibly juicy, incredibly flavorful finished dish. Traditionally, corned beef is cooked low and slow-but if you don't have three or four hours to stand stove-side, opt instead for pressure cooker preparation.

The chicken is paired with plenty of poblano peppers, giving each bite a fresh-chili flavor and mild heat. Four kinds of cheese (ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan & Romano) fill out the filling, along with heavy cream, and breadcrumbs-all seasoned with oregano, garlic, sea salt, and black pepper, then wrapped in egg & durum wheat pasta. Whew!While a pasta of this pedigree doesn't need much more than a drizzle of olive oil to shine, we're never ones to resist upping the ante. In this recipe, we've paired the Ravioli with Trader Joe's Mexican Style Roasted Corn with Cotija Cheese for an extra hit of heat and fresh corn flavor. What's more, it can be on the table (read: in your belly!) in about 20 minutes.",

The veggies are organically grown, blanched & gently cooked with organic garlic, onions, parsley, and savory spices.This process yields tender-crisp veggies that cook up perfectly when you get them home, and don't require further fussing to make them taste phenomenal. Add a crisp baguette, a strip steak, and a drizzle of zingy Trader Joe's Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce, and you've got a simple, satisfying steak dinner for two.",

Taken from Japanese, the word translates to \"pleasant savory taste,\" and really, it's just that. And Trader Joe's Mushroom & Company Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend is really just something you're going to want to put on... everything. To create this Umami Seasoning Blend, we began with kosher salt, and used a flavor base of porcini and white button mushrooms - earthy mushroom flavor really is the cornerstone of umami, which is why we named it Mushroom & Company. The ingredient list also includes onion, mustard seed, red & black pepper, and thyme. It's a boon mixed into turkey burgers, stirred into scrambled eggs, or used to elevate the flavors of... everything, really, a sprinkle at a time.",

The flake format makes mixing so much easier, and ensures rich, ripe, consistent banana flavor in each loaf.While it makes a classic loaf prepared per the package instructions, this veritably versatile, undoubtedly delicious Mix is amenable to all manner of mix-ins-walnuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit, more banana... In this decidedly more tropical take, on a banana bread recipe, we've added organic coconut and chopped candied ginger to the batter before baking.",

But if you're seeking something even more dessert-y, say, for an after-dinner treat or booster club bake sale, you can follow the recipe below for a pumpkin bar of sorts that's decidedly more \"brownie\" in texture than \"bread.\" The sweet, sour cream topping is by no means required, but will make these bars all the more delicious.",

There are just two ingredients inside every jar: peanuts from the southeastern United States, and salt. That is all. However, with just a few more ingredients (and this handy recipe), you can take peanut butter from simply scrumptious to downright droolworthy. Here, we've turned the classic peanut butter cookie on its head by enveloping the dough around our customers' favorite Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups before baking. The result is an ooey-gooey, sweet-salty cookie treat that's not to be missed. Be sure to have an ice-cold glass of milk or your favorite non-dairy beverage handy when these come out of the oven!",

Our supplier carefully folds dozens of extra-thin, extra-delicate layers of all-butter dough on top of one another multiple times over, then cuts the multilayered dough into triangles and bakes them to crisp perfection. The result is a batch of unique, fan-shaped Cookies that taste a bit like a cross between an actual cr&ecirc;pe and a homemade warm-vanilla waffle cone, and that eat a bit like a croissant-another extra-buttery, light-and-flaky French specialty that we know & love.While these Cr&ecirc;pe Wafer Cookies have been known to incite \"Yums!\" of crunchy delight served solo, they're also excellent served alongside ice cream, coffee, sliced fruit, freshly whipped cream, pudding...",

The dark brown wafer is cocoa-flavored, while the golden wafer tastes like vanilla. Between the wafers is a layer of strawberry-flavored creme that includes flecks of freeze-dried strawberries. While we consider Neapolitan Joe-Joe's to be cosmopolitan cookies in their own right, we're always up for some sweet experimentation. In this recipe, we blend them with velvety cream cheese, then coat the cookie mixture in deep, dark chocolate to create rich truffles that are packed with Neapolitan Joe-Joe flavor.",

Each one bakes into a wonderfully golden crust that's flaky on the fork and sturdy enough to carry a hearty amount of filling. Plus, these Crusts are extra easy to work with, so you can skip all that pastry chef perspiration! Simply remove one from the box (there are two), let it thaw, unroll it into a pie plate, fill, then bake. This functionally flattened pie recipe (featuring the aforementioned flaky Crusts) is perfect for picnics and parties. Feel free to substitute your favorite fruit for the peaches-just be sure to taste and adjust the sugar accordingly prior to baking.",

Top with vanilla cake layer; as lightly as you like frost sides of the entire cake with remaining buttercream.",

Blend. For more texture, stir in the other half of the bag of blueberries without blending. Remove pops from the freezer and carefully spoon in the \"white\" second layer, the honey yogurt until each cup is about 2/3 full.
